# We use while when we don't have a defined end for a loop
# A for loop is a kind of loop that repeats unitil maximum number of times

# adding numbers in a range (list)
# sum = 0
# for each in range(10):

# the first number is the lower limit and the second number is the upper limit and 3 is the distance
