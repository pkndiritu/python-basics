# Assignment operators using =

# a = 100
# this means a has been assigned 100
# total = 1+1+1+1+2+3+3

# Arithmetic operators
# + addition
# - subtraction
# * multiplication
# / division
# ** exponential
# % modules(gives the reminder of values)

# c = 10%3
# print(c)

# Comparison operators
# comparison operators are used with conditional statements
# z = 10
# y = 11
# w = z < y
# print(w)

# d = 1
# e = 1
# print(d!=e)

# Logical operators
# and
# all conditions must be true
# or
# at least one condition must be true to evaluate true
# not
# it negates conditions gives the opposite
# print(not(1<3 and 2>4 or 3>3))
